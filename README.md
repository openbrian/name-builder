name-builder is a simple username generator with the goal of providing a diversity of usernams based on list of common names, places, adjectives, and objects.

# How does it work?

It currently generates 1 username at a time.

First it selects a random form from `forms.csv`, for example.

| term1 | term 2 | term 3 | term 4 | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| noun:name_generated | literal:from | noun:city |
| noun:name_generated | literal:from | adjective:weather | noun:moon |

Alternate forms are in forms_unused.csv.  To use them, just move the desired line into forms.cvs.

TODO: Find a good way to select and deselect forms; probably CLI arguments.

Types of terms:

* literal means use the given word on the right side.
* parameter means use an input parameter from the CLI (TODO).
* noun - look up a noun from the list
* adjective - look up an adjective from the list.

noun:name_generated is a list of names, at this time hard coded to medievalish names.

"adjective:weather" means look up a random form of weather.  There's a list of lists, lists.csv which specifies which file to use.

There are numerous lists included.  Some may not even be included in forms, for example mythical_characters.

After resolving all terms, just join them together and print it.

# Testing

Since it uses randomness, it can also set a seed for testing.
